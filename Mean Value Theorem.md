If *f* is continuous on the closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ and differentiable on the open interval $\left(a,b\right)$, then there exists a number *c* in $\left(a,b\right)$ such that

$f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=\frac{f\left(b\right)-f\left(a\right)}{b-a}$

The "mean" in the Mean Value Theorem refers to the mean (or average) rate of change of *f* on the interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$.
