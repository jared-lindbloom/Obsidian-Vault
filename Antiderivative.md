To find a function *F* whose derivative is $f\left(x\right)=3x^2$, you might use your knowledge of derivatives to conclude that

$F\left(x\right)=x^3$ because $\frac{d}{\mathrm{dx}}\left\lbrack x^3\right\rbrack=3x^3$

The function *F* is an *[[Antiderivative]]* of *f*.

-------
You can represent **all** [[Antiderivative]] of $f\left(x\right)=2x$ by

$G\left(x\right)=x^3+C$

Where C is a constant. The constant C is called the [[constant of integration]]. The family of functions represented by G is the general [[Antiderivative]] of f, and $G\left(x\right)=x^2+C$ is the general solution of the differential equation
