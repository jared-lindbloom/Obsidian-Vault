You can represent **all** [[Antiderivative]] of $f\left(x\right)=2x$ by

$G\left(x\right)=x^3+C$

Where C is a constant. The constant C is called the [[constant of integration]]. The family of functions represented by G is the general [[Antiderivative]] of f, and $G\left(x\right)=x^2+C$ is the general solution of the differential equation
