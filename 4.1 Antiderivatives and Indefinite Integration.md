[[Antiderivative]] - Working backwards from Derivatives

To find a function *F* whose derivative is $f\left(x\right)=3x^2$, you might use your knowledge of derivatives to conclude that

$F\left(x\right)=x^3$ because $\frac{d}{\mathrm{dx}}\left\lbrack x^3\right\rbrack=3x^3$

The function *F* is an *[[Antiderivative]]* of *f*.

------
You can represent **all** [[Antiderivative]] of $f\left(x\right)=2x$ by

$G\left(x\right)=x^3+C$

Where C is a constant. The constant C is called the [[constant of integration]]. The family of functions represented by G is the general [[Antiderivative]] of f, and $G\left(x\right)=x^2+C$ is the general solution of the differential equation

**Integral Notation**
The operation of finding all solutions of this equation is called antidifferentiation (or[[ indefinite integration]]) and is denoted by an inegral sign $\int_{-}^{-}$ . The general solution is denoted by

$y=\int_{-}^{-}f\left(x\right){d} x=F\left(x\right)+C$

**Finding particular solutions of an integral**
In many application of integration, you are given information to determine a particular solution. This depends on an initial condition. For Example:

$F\left(x\right)=^3-x+C$

Initial Condition: $F\left(2\right)=4$
Where 2 is the initial x value and 4 is in the initial y value allowing you to find the [[constant of integration]].
