**Average Rate of change**
[[Secant Line]] - A Line that intersects a curve in two points
Average Rate of Change:
- Slope of the secant line
- Change in s over change in t
- Average rate of change in position - velociety
  (Change in position over change in time)
[[Tangent Line]] - A line that intersects a curve at exactly one point
- Slope of a line is constant
- Slope of a curve is constantly changing

**Slope of a curve at a Point**
$m=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f\left(a+h\right)-f\left(a\right)}{h}$
The slope of the curve at $y=f\left(x\right)$  at the point $P\left(a,f\left(a\right)\right)$ is the number, provided the limit exists
*This expression is called the [[Difference Quotient]]*

**Normal Line to a curve** - Line perpendicular to the tangent at that point

**How the derivative may not exist:**
- When there is a [[corner]]
- When there is a [[cusp]]
- Where there is a [[vertical tangent]]
- A [[Discontinuity]] occurs 
	- Example: The Unit Step Function

**[[Differentiability]] and [[Continuity]]**
- Differentiability implies Continuity
- Continuity does not imply Differentiability
$D\longrightarrow{}C$
$NOT$ $C\longrightarrow{}D$
$NOT$ $C$ $\longrightarrow{}NOT$ $D$

[[Intermediate Value Theorem for Derivatives]]
- Suppose that $f\left(x\right)$ is differentiable on $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ and let $M$ be any number between $f^{\prime}\left(a\right)$ and $f^{\prime}\left(b\right)$. Then there exists a number c such that
	- a < c < b
	- $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=M$
- IVT tells us that it is possible for the function to take on the value M somewhere in the interval between a and b, but it doesn't tell us where or how many times
