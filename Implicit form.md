This is when an equation is written without respect to any variable specifically.

Example:
$xy=1$

Alternatively: [[Explicit form]]



Implicit Differentiation Process
1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with *respect to x*. 
2. Collect all terms involving $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$ on one side of the equation and move all other terms to the other side of the equation.
3. Factor out $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$ 
4. Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$
