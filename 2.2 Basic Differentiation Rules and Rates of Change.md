**[[Constant Rule]]**
The derivative of a constant function
$\frac{d}{{d} x}c=0$
------
**[[Power rule]]**
For Positive Integer Powers of x
If *n* is a rational number, then the function $f\left(x\right)=x^{n}$ is differential then,
$\frac{d}{{d} x}\left\lbrack x^{n}\right\rbrack=nx^{n-1}$
-----
**[[Constant Multiple Rule]]**
If *f* is a differentiable function and *c* is a real number, then *cf* is also differentiable

$\frac{d}{\mathrm{dx}}\left\lbrack cf\left(x\right)\right\rbrack=cf^{\prime}\left(x\right)$
-----
**[[Sum and Difference Rule]]**
The sum (or difference) of two differentiable functions *f* and *g* is itself differentiable. Moreover, the derivative of *f + g* (or *f - g*) is the sum (or difference) of the derivative of *f* and *g*.

Sum Rule
$\frac{d}{{d} x}\left\lbrack f\left(x\right)+g\left(x\right)\right\rbrack=f^{\prime}\left(x\right)+g^{\prime}\left(x\right)$

Difference Rule
$\frac{d}{\mathrm{d}x}\left\lbrack f\left(x\right)-g\left(x\right)\right\rbrack=f^{\prime}\left(x\right)-g^{\prime}\left(x\right)$

**Find Horizontal Tangents**
1. Find the Derivative
2. Set the derivative to 0
3. Find all values where 'y=0
-----
Rates of Change:
The average rate of change is determined by the average rate of change equation

$\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ Change in Speed of Change in Time
This is equal to the rate
Finding instantaneous rates of change using the [[Difference Quotient]] equation
