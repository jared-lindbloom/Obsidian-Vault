Solving Related Rates Problems
1. Identify all *given* quantities and quantities *to be determined*. Make a sketch and label the quantities.
2. Write an equation involving the variables whose rates of change either are given or are to be determined.
3. Using the [[Chain Rule]], implicitly differentiate both sides of the equation *with respect to time t*. 
4. *After* completing Step 3, substitute into the resulting equation all known values for the variables and their rates of change. Then solve for the required rate of change

Example:
A hypothetical square grows so that the length of its sides are increasing at a rate of 9 m/min. How fast is the area of the square increasing when the sides are 15m each?
A = Area of Square
s = Length of Sides
t = Time
Equation: $A=s^2$
Given rate: $\frac{ds}{\mathrm{dt}}=8$
Find: $\frac{dA}{\mathrm{dt}}$ when s=15

$\frac{dA}{\mathrm{dt}}=2s\cdot\frac{ds}{\mathrm{dt}}=240\frac{m^2}{\min}$ (When s = 15)
