Tangent Line Approximations
To Begin, consider a function *f* that is differentiable at *c*. The equation for the tangent line at the point $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$ is

$y-f\left(c\right)=f^{\prime}\left(c\right)\left(x-c\right)$
$y=f\left(c\right)+f^{\prime}\left(c\right)\left(x-c\right)$
(This equation is very simalar to the point slope form equation $y_1-y_2=m\left(x_1-x_2\right)$)

and is called the [[Tangent Line]] approximation (or linear approximation) of *f* at *c*. Because *c* is a constant, *y* is a linear function of *x*. Moreover, by restricting the values of *x* to those sufficiently close to *c*, the values of *y* can be used as approximations (to any desired degree of accuracy) of the values of the function *f*. In other words, as *x* approaches *c*, the limit of *y* is $f\left(c\right)$.

Definition of [[differential]]
Let $y=f\left(x\right)$ represent a function that is [[differentiable]] on an open interval containing *x*. The [[differential]] of x (denoted by dx) is any nonzero real number. The [[differential]] of y (denoted by dy) is 

$D y=f^{\prime}\left(x\right)D x$

In these problems dx no longer equals 1. This would need to be given in the problem!
