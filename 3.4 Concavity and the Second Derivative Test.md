[[Concavity]]
Let *f* be differentiable on an open interval *I*. The graph of *f* is **[[concave upward]]** on *I* when $f^{\prime}$ is increasing on the interval and **[[concave downward]]** on *I* when $f^{\prime}$ is decreasing on the interval.

**Test for Concavity**
Let *f* be a function whose second derivative exists on an open interval *I*.
1. If $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(x\right)>0$ for all *x* in *I*, then the graph of *f* is [[concave upward]] on *I*.
2. If $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(x\right)<0$ for all *x* in *I*, then the graph of *f* is [[concave downward]] on *I*.

**[[Points of Inflection]]**
Let *f* be a function that is continuous on an open interval, and let *c* be a point in the interval. If the graph of *f* has a tangent line at the point $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$, then this point is a [[Points of Inflection]] of the graph of *f* when the [[Concavity]] of *f* changes from upward to downward (or downward to upward) at the point.

Connecting Points of Inflection to the Derivative
If $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$ is a point of inflection of the graph of *f*, then either $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(c\right)=0$ or $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(c\right)$ down not exist.

**The Second Derivative Test**
In addition to testing for [[Concavity]], the second derivative can be used to perform a simple test for [[relative minimum]] and [[relative maximum]]. The test is based on the fact that if the graph of a function *f* is [[concave upward]] on an open interval containing *c*, and $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=0$, then $f\left(c\right)$ must be a [[relative minimum]] of *f*. Similarly, if the graph of function *f* is [[concave downward]] on an open interval containing *c*, and $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=0$, then $f\left(c\right)$ must be a [[relative maximum]] of *f*.

**Using the Second Derivative Test**
Let *f* be a function such that $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=0$ and the second derivative of *f* exists on an open interval containing *c*.
1. If $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(c\right)>0$, then *f* has a [[relative minimum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
2. If $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(c\right)<0$, then *f* has a [[relative maximum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
If $f^{\left(2\right)}\left(c\right)<0$, then the test fails. That is, *f* may have a [[relative maximum]], a [[relative minimum]], or neither. In such cases, you can use the First Derivative Test.
