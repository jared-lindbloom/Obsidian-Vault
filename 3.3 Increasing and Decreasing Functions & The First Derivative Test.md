**Increasing and Decreasing Functions**
A function *f* is **increasing** on an interval when, for any two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the interval $x_1<x_2$ implies $f\left(x_1\right)<f\left(x_2\right)$.
A function *f* is **decreasing** on an interval when, for any two numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ in the interval, $x_1<x_2$ implies $f\left(x_1\right)>f\left(x_2\right)$.

**Testing for Increasing an Decreasing Functions**
Let *f* be a function that is continuous on the closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ and differentiable on the open interval $\left(a,b\right)$.
1. If $f^{\prime}\left(x\right)>0$ for all *x* in $\left(a,b\right)$, then *f* is increasing on $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$.
2. If $f^{\prime}\left(x\right)<0$ for all *x* in $\left(a,b\right)$, then *f* is decreasing on $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$.
3. If $f^{\prime}\left(x\right)=0$ for all *x* in $\left(a,b\right)$, then *f* is constant on $\left\lbrack a.b\right\rbrack$

**The First Derivative Test**
Let *c* be a [[critical number]] of a function *f* that is continuous on an open interval *I* containing *c*. If *f* is differentiable on the interval, except possibly at *c*, then $f\left(c\right)$ can be classified as follows.
1. If $f^{\prime}\left(x\right)$ changes from negative to positive at *c*, then *f* has *relative minimum* at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
2. If $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)$ is changes from positive to negative at *c*, then *f* has a *relatie maximum* at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
3. If $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)$ is positive on both sides of *c* or negative on both sides of *c*, then $f\left(c\right)$ is neither a [[relative minimum]] nor a [[relative maximum]].
