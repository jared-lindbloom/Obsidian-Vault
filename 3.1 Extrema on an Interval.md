**Definition of [[Extrema]]**
Let *f* be defined on an interval *I* containing *c*.
1. $f\left(c\right)$ is the **minimum of f on I** when $f\left(c\right)\le f\left(x\right)$ for all *x* in *I*.
2. $f\left(c\right)$ is the **maximum of f on I** when $f\left(c\right)\ge f\left(x\right)$ for all *x* in *I*.
The minimum and maximum of a function on an interval are the extreme values or [[Extrema]], of the function on the interval. The minimum an maximum of a function on an interval are also called the [[absolute minimum]] and [[absolute maximum]], or the [[global minimum]] and [[global maximum]], on the interval. [[Extrema]] can occur at interior points or endpoints of an interval. [[Extrema]] that occur at the endpoints are called [[endpoint extrema]].

**Extreme Value Theorem**
If *f* is continuous on a closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ has both a minimum and a maximum on the interval.

**[[Relative Extrema]]**
1. If there is an open interval containing *c* on which $f\left(c\right)$ is a maximum, then $f\left(c\right)$ is called a [[relative maximum]] of *f*, or you can say that *f* has a [[relative maximum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
2. If there is an open interval containing *c* on which $f\left(c\right)$ is a minimum, then $f\left(c\right)$ is called a [[relative minimum]] of *f*, or you can say that *f* has a [[relative minimum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
The plural of [[relative maximum]] is relative maxima, and the plural of relative minimum is relative minima. A [[relative maximum]] is sometimes called a [[local maximum]], and a relative minimum is sometimes called a [[local minimum]].

**Definition of a Critical Number**
Let *f* be defined at *c*. If $f^{\prime}\left(c\right)=0$ or if *f* is not differentiable at *c*, then *c* is a [[critical number]] of *f*.

-----
**Finding [[Extrema]] on a Closed Interval**
To find the extrema of a continuous function *f* on a closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$, use these steps
1. Find the critical numbers of *f* in $\left(a,b\right)$.
2. Evaluate *f* at each critical number in $\left(a,b\right)$.
3. Evaluate *f* at each endpoint of $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$.
4. The least of these values is the minimum. The greatest is the maximum.
