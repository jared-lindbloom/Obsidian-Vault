If a function *f* is continuous on the closed $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ and *F* is an anti-derivative of *f* on the interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$,

$\int_{a}^{b}f\left(x\right)\mathrm{dx}=F\left(b\right)-F\left(a\right)$

**Mean Value Theorem for Integrals**
If *f* is continuous on the closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$, then there exists a number *c* in the closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$ such that 

$\int_{a}^{b}f\left(x\right)\mathrm{dx}=f\left(c\right)\left(b-a\right)$

This theorem does not state how to find the value of c, just that c would exist

We can find *c* with the average value of a function!
If *f* is integrable on the closed interval $\left\lbrack a,b\right\rbrack$, then the average value of *f* on the interval is,

$\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f\left(x\right)\mathrm{dx}$

**The Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus**
If *f* is continuous on an open interval *I* containing *a*, then, for every *x* in the interval, 

$\mathrm{\frac{d}{dx}\left\lbrack\int_{a}^{x}f\left(t\right)dt\right\rbrack}=f\left(x\right)$
