 1. If there is an open interval containing *c* on which $f\left(c\right)$ is a maximum, then $f\left(c\right)$ is called a [[relative maximum]] of *f*, or you can say that *f* has a [[relative maximum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
2. If there is an open interval containing *c* on which $f\left(c\right)$ is a minimum, then $f\left(c\right)$ is called a [[relative minimum]] of *f*, or you can say that *f* has a [[relative minimum]] at $\left(c,f\left(c\right)\right)$.
The plural of [[relative maximum]] is relative maxima, and the plural of relative minimum is relative minima. A [[relative maximum]] is sometimes called a [[local maximum]], and a relative minimum is sometimes called a [[local minimum]].

Relative Extrema ONLY occur at [[critical number]]s.
