[[Explicit form]] vs [[Implicit form]] Functions
Most functions we have done have been expressed in the [[explicit form]]. For example, in the equation $y=3x^2-5$, the variable *y* is explicitly written as function of *x*. Some functions, however, are only implied by an equation, For instance, the function $y=\frac{1}{x}$ is defined implicitly by the equation 

$xy=1$. Implicit Form

Implicit Differentiation Process
1. Differentiate both sides of the equation with *respect to x*. 
2. Collect all terms involving $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$ on one side of the equation and move all other terms to the other side of the equation.
3. Factor out $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$ 
4. Solve for $\frac{\mathrm{dy}}{\mathrm{dx}}$
